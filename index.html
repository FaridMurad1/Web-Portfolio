          Engineering Department. I am a competitive programmer and web
          developer passionate about solving challenging algorithmic problems
          and building efficient web solutions. I enjoy competing in coding
          contests like Codeforces, LeetCode, and AtCoder, while continuously
          enhancing my problem-solving skills and mastering programming
          techniques. My expertise spans arrays, strings, graphs, trees, binary
          search, and sliding window algorithms, alongside modern web
          development tools and technologies. I focus on writing optimized,
          structured C++ code and creating responsive, user-friendly web
          applications. My ultimate goal is to
